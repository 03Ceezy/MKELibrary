## ADC

Dependencies: fsl_adc12.h

### Setup

Configuration structs
- adc12_config_t
  - Reference voltage source
  - Clock source, prescale
  - Resolution
  - Sample clock count
    - Noise reduction thing?
  - Continuous conversion mode?
- adc12_channel_config_t
  - Channel number
  - Interrupt?

Clock set:
''' CLOCK_SetIpSrc(kCLOCK_Adc0, kCLOCK_IpSrcFircAsync); '''

''' ADC12_GetDefaultConfig() '''
- Voltage reference: between pins VrefH and VrefL
- Clock source: alt 0
- Clock prescale: 1
- Resolution: 8b
- Sample clock count: 13
- No continuous conversion

''' ADC12_Init '''
- Sets configuration based on adc12_config_t argument

''' ADC12_EnableHardwareTrigger '''
- If true is passed, ???
- If false is passed, starting conversion is done by calling a function. 

### Interrupt setup

Enable specific IRQ:
''' EnableIRQ(ADC0_IRQn) '''
- IRQn enum is defined in MKE18F16.h

Tie handler to request:
''' #define user_function ADC0_IRQn '''
- Handler names are in startup_mke18f1.c
  - Sequence is the same as in IRQn enum, but numbers are different.

Which interrupt corresponds to which IRQn? fukcing guess binch

### Conversion

Configure channel, in adc12_channel_config_t struct:
- Set channelNumber to input number (see datasheet)
- Set enableInterruptOnConversionCompleted to: 
  - False if manually checking  
  - True if IRQ handler is set up

Trigger conversion: 
- Call ADC12_SetChannelConfig
  - Pass ADC base, input channel group, and by adr channel config struct
