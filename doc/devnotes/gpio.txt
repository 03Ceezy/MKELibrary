## GPIO



General notes

The IO system is two peripherals; GPIO and PORT.
GPIO handles digital logic reading and writing.
PORT handles assigning pins to peripherals and pin interrupts.

Pin config tool must be used to set up PORT utility and associated clocks.
This library does not do that, yet.

Notes from part reference

"Each 32-pin port supports one interrupt."
Interrupts defined in startup file for ports A through E
     PORTX_IRQHandler

Pin configuration register
One register for each pin: PORTA_PCR0, etc.
 ISF: The pin has interrupted
     Every ISF is mirrored in port register PORTA_ISFR, etc.
 IRQC: When will the pin trigger interrupt?
 LK: Lock the register
 MUX: What is the pin's function?
 DSE: High or low drive strength?
 PFE: Passive filter?
 PE: Pull enable
 PS: Pull direction
